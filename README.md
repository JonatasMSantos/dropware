# Dropware

Dropware is an application that allows you to generate content using artificial intelligence. You can create conversations, music, images, videos, and code with the help of OpenAI and Replicate. Dropware has a dashboard and a menu with the following options:

- Conversation: Generate realistic and engaging dialogues with different personas and scenarios.
- Music Generation: Create original and catchy tunes with different genres and moods.
- Image Generation: Produce high-quality and diverse images with different styles and themes.
- Video Generation: Generate stunning and dynamic videos with different effects and transitions.
- Code Generation: Write functional and elegant code with different languages and frameworks.

Dropware uses PlanetScale (MySQL) for database, Clerk for authentication, and Stripe for payment. You can use Dropware for free for up to 5 times, and then you need to pay to use it more.

Dropware is built with Nextjs 14. It uses Crisp for chat and support, and Shadcn-ui and Tailwind for components and styling.
